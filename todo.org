* Emacs stuff that needs fixing
** TODO Fix proxy setup for anaconda.
- Currently I have to set export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1" in the shell before starting Emacs.
** TODO Open multiple files in ido-find-file
- Wildcards are not working.
** TODO Edit matches from occur or grep buffer
- Need to support searching in only one dir, not entire repo/project.
